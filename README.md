## Introduction to Competitive Programming
Competitive programming is a mind sport where participants solve well-defined computational problems within a time constraint. It not only tests a programmer's ability to solve problems efficiently but also requires proficiency in algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving techniques. This repository aims to support individuals in their journey through the exciting world of competitive programming.

## Getting Started
If you're new to competitive programming, don't worry! We have curated a list of resources to help you get started. This includes tutorials, articles, and recommended reading materials to familiarize yourself with fundamental concepts.

## Problem Solutions
One of the core components of this repository is the collection of solutions to various competitive programming problems. We encourage contributors to submit their solutions along with explanations to help others understand the thought process behind the code.

## Algorithms and Data Structures
A solid understanding of algorithms and data structures is essential for success in competitive programming. In this section, you'll find implementations of common algorithms and data structures in various programming languages. Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute your own implementations.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions from the community to make this repository even more valuable. Whether it's adding solutions to new problems, improving existing code, or suggesting new resources, your contributions are highly appreciated. Please refer to the CONTRIBUTING.md file for guidelines on how to contribute.
